# airbnb-clone-project

# About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world simulation of developing a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. It focuses on full-stack backend development with an emphasis on backend systems, database architecture, RESTful and GraphQL APIs, application security, and CI/CD integration. The project also emphasizes collaborative workflows, scalability, and effective documentation practices.

# Project Goals
1. Develop a scalable and secure booking platform.

2. Understand backend system architecture and data management.

3. Implement secure APIs using modern frameworks.

4. Practice collaborative development using Git and GitHub.

5. Design and maintain CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.

6. Apply industry best practices in documentation, testing, and code quality.

# Technology Stack
| Technology         | Purpose                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Django**         | A Python web framework used to build RESTful APIs and handle backend logic.             |
| **PostgreSQL**     | A relational database used to store user, property, and booking data.                   |
| **GraphQL**        | An alternative API approach enabling efficient client-server data querying.             |
| **Docker**         | Used for containerization to ensure consistent development and production environments. |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD tool used to automate testing, build, and deployment workflows.                   |
| **Markdown**       | For documentation and README formatting.                                                |



# Database Design
| Entity       | Fields                                             | Relationships                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**     | id, name, email, password, role                    | A user can create multiple properties and make multiple bookings. |
| **Property** | id, title, description, location, owner\_id        | Belongs to a user (owner). Can have many bookings and reviews.    |
| **Booking**  | id, property\_id, user\_id, start\_date, end\_date | Belongs to a user and a property.                                 |
| **Review**   | id, property\_id, user\_id, rating, comment        | Belongs to a property and submitted by a user.                    |
| **Payment**  | id, booking\_id, amount, payment\_status           | Tied to a booking. One booking has one payment.                   |


# Feature Breakdown
   - User Management
Enables users to register, log in, update profiles, and manage sessions securely.

   - Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with detailed metadata and photos.

   - Booking System
Enables users to search for properties and make reservations with date validation and availability checking.

   - Reviews and Ratings
Users can leave feedback on properties, aiding quality control and improving user trust.

   - Payments Integration
Facilitates secure transactions between guests and hosts via payment gateways.

   - Admin Panel
Allows admins to manage users, properties, bookings, and monitor platform activities.

# API Security
To protect sensitive user data and ensure secure interactions:

1.   Authentication
   - Implemented using token-based (JWT) or session-based authentication to verify user identity.

2.   Authorization
  - Role-based access control ensures that users only access resources theyâ€™re allowed to.

3.   Rate Limiting
  - Protects the platform from abuse and DDoS attacks by limiting API request rates.

4.   Data Validation & Sanitization
  - Prevents injection attacks and ensures safe input handling across endpoints.

5.   HTTPS Enforcement
  - Encrypts data in transit to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.

# CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate code testing, integration, and deployment. This ensures fast feedback, reduced errors, and consistent delivery across environments.

   - CI Tools: GitHub Actions for running tests and checks on every pull request.

   - CD Tools: Docker for containerization, GitHub Actions for deployment, and optional integration with platforms like Heroku or AWS EC2 for production deployment.

   - Pipeline Stages:

      - Linting & Unit Testing

      - Build and Docker Image Creation

      - Deployment to staging/production
